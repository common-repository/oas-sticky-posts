OAS Sticky Posts is a side-bar widget that lists & links to important blog posts.

== Description ==

OAS Sticky Posts is a simple side-bar widget that is similar to the commonly used 'recent posts' widget.

However, rather than linking to the most recent posts, OAS Sticky Posts lets the blog author link to posts they deem important - for whatever reason they deem it so (e.g. favourite).

It was originally developed for AlanHart.net and you can see it in action over there.
